What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

****I worked with Nathalie Trouba on this assignment.****

 While I think I have a strong program started, and I was able to print the RTT, I have had a lot of issues with the particulars of sockets and getting the header of the reply & timestamp to print in the while loop. Furthermore, I am not able to figure out how to run my traceroute code successfully, as it keeps redirecting me to an error in checkSum() within ICMPpinger.py. I found this assignment very difficult, but I will definitely come to your OH on Wednesday to talk with you about it and hopefully clear up some of my confusion. My hope is that I can correct this homework! If I were to give advice to someone taking this course in the future, it would be to read the starter code thoroughly in order to inform your approach to writing your own code. I found the starter code to be a really helpful guide. 

Test your `ping` and `traceroute` programs on 4 target hosts, each on a different continent and include the output below.
